    "### The dataset, titled \"Healthcare Stroke Dataset,\" contains information on various health-related attributes of individuals to predict stroke occurrences. It includes 12 columns such as gender, age, hypertension, heart_disease, avg_glucose_level, and bmi. Categorical data like smoking_status and work_type are also present, along with the target variable stroke indicating whether a person experienced a stroke. This dataset is valuable for building machine learning models to understand and predict stroke risk factors. Cleaning and preprocessing, such as handling missing values and encoding categorical variables, are necessary for effective analysis.\n",
